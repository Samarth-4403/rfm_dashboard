Building an RFM Analytics Dashboard using Python

An analytics dashboard is a data visualization tool that aggregates, 
displays, and analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics, and 
other key data points related to a business, department, or specific process.

RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customersâ€™:

    1. recency (the date they made their last purchase)
    2. frequency (how often they make purchases)
    3. monetary value (the amount spent on purchases)

The code performs a thorough RFM analysis on customer data, calculating 
recency, frequency, and monetary scores for each customer. It then segments
customers into different groups based on their RFM scores, such as
"Champions," "Potential Loyalists," and "At Risk Customers." This 
analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps
businesses identify their most valuable customers, target marketing
efforts effectively, and understand customer churn risks. The code also 
visualizes the results using various charts, including bar charts,
treemaps, boxplots, and heatmaps, to make the findings more 
understandable and actionable.

The provided code creates an interactive dashboard using Dash to visualize 
the RFM analysis results generated in the previous script. The dashboard 
layout includes a dropdown menu that allows users to select the desired 
chart type, such as "RFM Value Segment Distribution," "Distribution of RFM 
Values within Customer Segment," "Correlation Matrix of RFM Values within 
Champions Segment," "Comparison of RFM Segments," or "Comparison of RFM 
based on Scores." When a user selects a chart type, the update_chart 
callback function is triggered, which retrieves the corresponding chart 
figure from the previously defined variables and displays it in the 
dashboard's graph container. This interactive feature enables users to 
explore the RFM analysis results in a more dynamic and user-friendly 
manner, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and 
segmentation.
